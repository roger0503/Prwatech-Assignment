# Prwatech-Assignment
## DESCRIPTION
This work was centered on implementation of a simple scientific
calculator. This calculator as a tool to completely change mathematical
knowledge and sophisticated problems solving strategies had advanced
the field of simulated engine in mathematic.
This project work also focused principally on numbers and arithmetic
operation. The end result of simple calculator system was its ability to
process number and operators, and provides a useful result. By using
this calculator we can easily perform addition, division, multiplication,
subtraction, XOR operation, NOT operation, AND operation,
factorial, fibonacci, palindrome, permutation, combination, mean, median,
variance, standard deviation etc.
This project is implemented by using different functions, loops and
collections in python.
Therefore, this project will help immensely in the following way. Easy
calculating of tedious mathematical problems, easy to retrieval of errors.
